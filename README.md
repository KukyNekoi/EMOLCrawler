# EMOL Crawler
This is a small script to crawl EMOL news using selenium webdriver, intented to be used as a library on other programs. By default has a delay of 1 second after full load.

## Prerequistites (assuming that you're using Firefox backend)
* [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) (whilist I do recommend conda tho)

## PIP libraries
Just run this command to install the required libraries, as you only need selenium and pandas.

```bash
pip install selenium pandas
```

## Execution
```bash
python demo.py
```
